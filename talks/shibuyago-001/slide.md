### Markdown driven presentation tool

> This slides are shown by **revealgo**!

---

## How to make presentation

1. Write Markdown file
2. Run `revealgo` command
3. Open slides on your web browser

## Wrapper of `reveal.js`

`reveal.js`

+Mini HTTP server

+Command Line Interface

=**revealgo**

---

## Mini HTTP server

* Render `index.html`
* Serve JavaScript/CSS/Font files in `reveal.js`
* Embed the specified Markdown file

---

## Command Line Interface

`revealgo` [options] SLIDE.md

```
$ revealgo -p 3001 --theme moon --transition zoom slide.md
```

---

## Sample Markdown

```
## This is an H2 Title

Description...

* Item1
* Item2
* Item3

The horizontal slide separator characters are '---'
The vertical slide separator characters are '___'

```

___

## This is a vertical slide

The origin of these ideas **is not** revealgo

---

## App::revealup

* The origin of revealgo
* One of **Perl** CPAN modules
* <https://metacpan.org/pod/App::revealup>
* Written by me :)

---

## Perl to Go

* Make it more simple
* Deplicate subcommand `serve`/`export`
* Use the standard HTTP and Template libraries
* **610** lines => **202** lines

---

## Libraries

* `Plack::Runner` => `ServeHTTP` + CLI
* `Getopt::Long` => `github.com/jessevdk/go-flags`
* `Text::MicroTemplate` => `text/template`

---

## How about Go?

* Easy to install with `go get` or using the binary
* Standard libraries are modern for web apps
* Static types and compiler
* But we can write the code like script languages

---

## Wrap-up
